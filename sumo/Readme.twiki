This is the sumo model for Wool

To compile:

./configure --prefix=/home/usr/local/sumo-0.26.0





1. export osm file from OSM

edit with OSM editor to remove unwanted elements


2. convert to Sumo file

Convert info found at:
http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Tutorials/Import_from_OpenStreetMap


Dowload http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Osm-urban-de.typ.xml

NOTE: had to change highway.primary and highway.secondary to be single lane

netconvert --lefthand --type-files osm-urban-de.typ.xml --ramps.guess --remove-edges.by-vclass hov,taxi,bus,delivery,truck,tram,rail_urban,rail,rail_electric,motorcycle,bicycle,pedestrian --geometry.remove --remove-edges.isolated --tls.join --verbose --osm-files WoolStriped.osm --output-file wool.net.xml



3. create routes

we need to create routes, the best way to do this is to create "flows" this is a special way to create lots of traffic at a specific flow

duarouter --flow-files wool.flow.xml --net-file wool.net.xml --output-file wool.rou.xml


duarouter --flow-files wool.impactswool.xml --net-file wool.net.xml --output-file wool.rou.xml -b 0 -e 3600


Flow Data
---------

wool.impactswool.xml:


The wool.impactswool.xml flows file is based upon the flows from the inpact assessment. 


wool.estflows.xml:


The wool.estflows.xml flows file is based upon the flows from the traffic survey data. 


wool.est1000flows.xml:

The wool.est1000flows.xml flows file is based upon the flows from the traffic survey data along with the extra 1000 house TRIP data added into it.
